# Undetected Respiratory Disease Outbreaks (URDO) 

### Description
[The URDO project](https://www.cdc.gov/urdo/index.html) has he goal of improving detection and diagnosis of respiratory pathogens, \
including bacteria like _Bordetella pertussis_ and _Legionella pneumophila_, as well as viruses such as influenza \
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). To do this, the CDC has been collaborating with other state public health \
laboratories to develop a chip-based multiplexed PCR assay, which will be followed by next-generation sequencing \
and bioinformatics analysis for pathogen detection (which microbe is this?) and characterization (for e.g., typing, \
searching for resistance genes, etc).

The CDC team is led by Jonas Winchell at the CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), and \
the two state laboratories involved include the Massachusetts State Laboratory and Minnesota Department of Public Health. \

### Goals
The URDO project utilized k-mer-based methods for pathogen detection and characterization. Since the project remains unfinished \
and unpublished, these bioinformatic pipelines have been removed from the repository and its history via [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).  

Tiffany specifically worked on two parts of the project:
1. Primer generation for the chip-based multiplexed PCR
2. Visualization of the bioinformatics results 

# Instructions
Instructions for primer generation are located within the `primers` folder, while the script for visualization is located \
in `kmer/visualization`.
